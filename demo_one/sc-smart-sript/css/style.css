/**
 * Fixed Spacing Variables:
 * Though we can use relative units for most cases, we still need some fixed variable to overcome some drawbacks of relative units.
 * Example we don't want the left and right side padding of container to be increased relatively to the font-size.
 * The vertical spacing between two modules to be same regardless of increasing the font-size.
 * The spacing scale is a base-8 scale. We chose a base-8 scale because eight is a highly composable number (it can be divided and multiplied many times and result in whole numbers), yet allows spacing dense enough for UI. The scale's exception is that it begins at 4px to allow smaller padding and margin for denser parts of the site, from there on it steps up consistently in equal values of 8px.

 *
 * Font-sizes bigger than 20px should activate aliased smoothing,
 * then increase font-weight to 300
 *
 * If we're on IE, and font-size
 * is less or equal than 17px and font-weight is less than 400,
 * then font-weight is increased to improve readibility.

 * @params
 * $font-size: font size
 * $font-weight: font weight
 * $antialiased: boolean to active aliased smoothing
 * $supers: collection of parent classes to apply the mixin, they have to be separated by comas
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *.component---header---title {
 *   @include safe-font-size(15px, 300, false, '.is-upload-step', '.bp-small', '.bp-medium');
 * }
 *
 * The $supers refers to the parent classes, so in this case, the mixin apply when the parent class is .is-upload-step,
 * bp-small or bp-medium
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * .component---info.type---header {
 *    .component---info---title {
 *      @include safe-font-size(52px, 300, false, '.layout-2cols');
 *    }
 * }
 *
 * The font size here is 52px, bigger than 20px, so the aliased smoothing should activate.
 * The $supers is only one, so the mixin only apply to the '.layout-2cols .component---info.type---header .component---info---title'
